## 1. Core Architecture & Technology Stack

The backend infrastructure will be built on a modern, scalable stack to support real-time interactions and secure transactions.

- **Programming Language/Framework:** Node.js with the Express.js framework.
- **Database:** MongoDB Atlas (NoSQL Document Database).
- **Real-Time Communication:** WebSockets (e.g., using Socket.IO) for live job status tracking, chat, and notifications.
- **Authentication:**
  - **Primary:** Email/Password and Phone/Password authentication using JWTs (JSON Web Tokens), including a secure password reset flow.
  - **Secondary (Optional):** Social authentication providers.
- **File Storage:** Cloudinary for managing and serving profile pictures, job images, and verification documents.
- **Push Notifications:** Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for sending critical alerts to both client and craftsman mobile apps.
- **System Monitoring & Logging:** Integration with Sentry for error tracking, LogRocket for session replay/debugging, and other standard uptime monitoring tools.

---

## 2. Key Functional Requirements

These are the core features that the backend must support to enable the end-to-end user journeys.

### 2.1. User & Job Management

- **User Roles:** System must support distinct roles: client, craftsman, admin, and moderator.
- **Craftsman Verification:** API endpoints for craftsmen to upload skill tags and certification documents. An admin-facing workflow to review and approve/reject craftsman profiles.
- **Job Lifecycle Management:**
  - Endpoints for clients to CREATE, READ, UPDATE, and DELETE job postings.
  - Functionality for craftsmen to browse available jobs and submit structured quotes.
  - A state machine for job status tracking (e.g., Posted, Quoted, Hired, On The Way, Completed, Disputed, Cancelled).

### 2.2. Payments, Wallet, and Fees

- **Payment Gateway Integration:** Deep integration with Stripe Connect and FawryPay.
- **Payment Flows:** Support for Escrow, Standard Cash, and Cash with Protected Payment.
- **Craftsman Wallet System:** A dedicated wallet for each craftsman with auto-deductions, top-up capability, and withdrawal processing.
- **Fee Remittance:** Automated system for tracking and reminding craftsmen to remit fees from cash jobs.

### 2.3. Ratings, Disputes, & Cancellations

- **Double-Blind Rating System:** Ratings are revealed only after both parties submit or after 14 days.
- **Dispute Resolution Workflow:** A system for users to raise disputes and for admins to manage them.
- **Cancellation Logic:** Rules for cancellation based on job status.

### 2.4. Craftsman Invitations

- **Craftsman Invitations**:

  - Clients can now invite specific craftsmen to posted jobs.
  - Craftsmen can accept or reject invitations.
  - Accepted craftsmen can submit quotes.

### 2.5. Notification System

- The system must notify users of important events (invitations, quotes, status changes, etc.) via in-app, push, and/or email.
- Notifications are stored in a `notifications` collection.
- Real-time delivery is supported via WebSocket (Socket.IO).
- Users can fetch and mark notifications as read via API.

#### Notification Events Table

| Event                        | Recipient    | Channel(s)          |
| ---------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------- |
| Craftsman invited to job     | Craftsman    | In-app, Push, Email |
| Craftsman applies/quotes     | Client       | In-app, Push, Email |
| Invitation accepted/rejected | Client       | In-app, Push, Email |
| Job status changes           | Both parties | In-app, Push, Email |

### 2.6. AI Recommendations

- The system provides AI-powered recommendations to clients for inviting craftsmen to jobs.
- Recommendations are based on job parameters, required skills, location proximity, craftsman ratings, past job performance, and availability.
- The recommendation engine may use machine learning, rule-based logic, or a hybrid approach.
- Clients can request recommendations when creating or managing a job.

---

## 3. Admin & Operational Backend

- **Admin Tooling:** Secure endpoints for all admin functions with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), including Moderator role management.
- **CRM & Reporting:** Endpoints to fetch user history and generate data for BI dashboards.
- **AI & Automation:** Backend support for AI-powered job matching and an FAQ chatbot.

---

## 4. Security & Non-Functional Requirements

- **Data Security & Backups:**
  - Utilize MongoDB Atlas's built-in automated backup features.
  - Store backups in multi-region replicas.
  - Ensure a Recovery Time Objective (RTO) of less than 2 hours.
  - Securely encrypt and store sensitive craftsman KYC data.
- **Data Privacy:** Implement API endpoints and corresponding database logic for GDPR-inspired data deletion requests.
- **Performance SLAs:**
  - Push Notification Latency: < 5 seconds.
  - Payout Processing: < 2 business days.
  - Dispute Resolution: < 72 hours median time.

## 7. Implementation & Operational Details

### 7.1. Environment Variables

The following environment variables are required for the backend to function:

```env
# Database
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/craftworks
# JWT
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
# Email (Resend)
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key_here
# Cloudinary (for image uploads)
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
```

### 7.2. Image Upload (Cloudinary)

- Profile images are uploaded to Cloudinary and stored in the `profile-images` folder.
- Images are automatically resized to 400x400 pixels and optimized.
- Old profile images are automatically deleted when a new one is uploaded.
- Supported formats: JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP.
- Maximum file size: 5MB.
- Temporary files are automatically cleaned up after upload.

### 7.3. Logging & Monitoring

- All HTTP requests are logged (e.g., using morgan).
- Application events and errors are logged (e.g., using winston).
- Logs are written to:
  - `logs/combined.log` (all logs)
  - `logs/error.log` (errors only)
- All errors, warnings, and important events are timestamped and logged.
- Console output is also formatted and timestamped.

### 7.4. Error Handling

- **404 Not Found:** Any request to a non-existent `/api/...` route returns `{ "message": "API route not found" }` with status 404.
- **Invalid ObjectId:** If a route expects an ObjectId and you pass an invalid string, you get `{ "message": "Resource not found (invalid ID)" }` with status 404.
- **Global Error Handler:** All unhandled errors return `{ "message": "Internal server error" }` with status 500 (unless a more specific status is set).
- All errors are logged with details about the request and error.

### 7.5. Authentication & Authorization (Updated)

- All protected endpoints require a Bearer JWT token in the `Authorization` header.
- The `type` field in login determines which roles can log in:
  - `clients`: Only users with role `client` or `craftsman` can log in (for website/mobile app).
  - `admins`: Only users with role `admin` or `moderator` can log in (for dashboard).
  - If the role does not match the type, a 403 Forbidden error is returned.
- Blocked users receive a specific error response with block reason and timestamp.
- Only **clients** can invite craftsmen to jobs they own.
- Only **craftsmen** can respond to invitations.
- Role-based access enforced with 403 Forbidden errors.

### 7.6. User Roles & Permissions

- **admin:** Can manage users, jobs, services, reports, etc.
- **moderator:** Can moderate content and manage reports, but cannot access admin-only endpoints like activity logs.
- **client:** Can post jobs, review craftsmen, message, etc.
- **craftsman:** Can submit proposals, manage profile, message, etc.

### 7.7. User Ratings

- Every user (client or craftsman) has a `rating` (average, 1-5) and `ratingCount` (number of received reviews) field on their user profile.
- Ratings are updated automatically whenever a review is created or updated.
- Both clients and craftsmen can review each other after a job is completed, but only after the contract is marked as completed and only once per contract.

### 7.8. Pagination

- All paginated endpoints return:
  ```json
  {
    "data": [ ... ],
    "pagination": {
      "page": 1,
      "limit": 10,
      "totalPages": 5,
      "totalItems": 42
    }
  }
  ```

### 7.9. HTTP Status Codes

- `200 OK`: Successful GET, PUT, DELETE
- `201 Created`: Successful POST
- `400 Bad Request`: Invalid input
- `401 Unauthorized`: Not logged in or invalid token
- `403 Forbidden`: Not allowed
- `404 Not Found`: Resource does not exist
- `500 Server Error`: Unexpected error

### 7.10. Business Logic (Updated)

- For user update endpoints, support profile image upload, optional fields, and validation.
- For password change, require current and new password, validate length, and return appropriate error messages.
- For job, proposal, contract, review, and message flows, clarify who can access or modify what, and under what conditions (e.g., only job owner, admin, or moderator can update/delete jobs).
- A craftsman cannot be invited more than once to the same job.
- Accepted invitations allow direct quote submission.
- Clients cannot re-invite rejected craftsmen unless job is recreated.
- Only active jobs (status = `Posted`) can have invitations sent.

### 7.11. Activity Logging

- All important actions (user registration, admin actions, deletions, service changes, etc.) are logged in the ActivityLog collection.
- Each log entry includes: who did the action, what action, what target, details, and timestamp.
- Only admins can access the activity log endpoint.

### 7.12. Resource Relationships

- **Jobs â†’ Proposals â†’ Contracts â†’ Reviews**
- A job is posted by a client, craftsmen submit proposals, client accepts a proposal to create a contract, contract is completed, then both parties can review each other.

### 7.13. Job Status Flow (Updated)

```mermaid
graph TD
    open["Posted"] --> invite["Craftsman Invited"]
    invite --> accepted["Invitation Accepted"]
    accepted --> proposal["Proposal Submitted"]
    proposal --> contract["Proposal Accepted"]
    contract --> inprogress["In Progress"]
    inprogress --> completed["Completed"]
    completed --> reviewed["Reviewed"]
```

### 7.14. File Uploads

- Use `/api/services/uploads` as a placeholder for now. In production, integrate with S3, Cloudinary, or similar.
